**Workshop**: Data Storytelling Workshop
**Purpose**: Help students use AI to refine their insight-driven slide titles

## Basic Title Refinement Prompt

```
I'm creating a presentation slide about marketing channel performance data.

Here's what my data shows:
- Email marketing: $60 cost per conversion, 420 conversions
- Paid search: $71 cost per conversion, 350 conversions
- Social media: $294 cost per conversion, 85 conversions
- Display ads: $556 cost per conversion, 45 conversions

My current slide title is: "[YOUR CURRENT TITLE]"

Help me write an Takeaway Title that:
1. States the "so what" - not just what the data shows
2. Implies what action should be taken
3. Is clear and concise (under 15 words ideally)
4. Would help a CMO decide on budget allocation

Please provide 3 alternative titles with brief explanations of why each works.
```

## Advanced: Iterative Refinement

### Step 1: Generate Options
```
Based on this marketing data, give me 5 different insight-driven slide titles:
- Email: 420 conversions at $60 each
- Paid Search: 350 conversions at $71 each
- Social: 85 conversions at $294 each
- Display: 45 conversions at $556 each

Make each title approach the insight from a different angle.
```

### Step 2: Evaluate Options
```
Here are my title options:
1. [Title 1]
2. [Title 2]
3. [Title 3]

For each title, rate it on:
- Clarity (1-5): Is the insight immediately clear?
- Action (1-5): Does it imply what to do?
- Impact (1-5): Would it grab a busy executive's attention?

Then recommend which title is strongest and why.
```

### Step 3: Final Polish
```
I've chosen this title: "[YOUR CHOSEN TITLE]"

Help me polish it by:
1. Making it more specific if needed
2. Ensuring the numbers are accurate
3. Checking it's not too long for a slide
4. Making sure it sounds confident, not hedging
```

## Common Patterns for Takeaway Title Titles

### The Comparison Pattern
```
Help me write a title that compares the best performer to the worst:
- Best: Email at $60/conversion
- Worst: Display at $556/conversion
- Ratio: ~9x difference

Example format: "[Best thing] delivers [X]x better results than [worst thing]"
```

### The Recommendation Pattern
```
Help me write a title that implies a clear recommendation:
- Data shows email marketing is most efficient
- Context: CMO deciding budget allocation

Example format: "[Action word] [specific thing] to [achieve outcome]"
```

### The Surprising Finding Pattern
```
Help me write a title that highlights a surprising insight:
- Display ads got 2M impressions but only 45 conversions
- Email got only 150K impressions but 420 conversions

Example format: "[Counter-intuitive finding] - [brief explanation]"
```

## What Makes a Title "Takeaway Title"?

### NOT Takeaway Title (Descriptive)
- "Q4 Marketing Channel Performance"
- "Conversion Rates by Channel"
- "Marketing Spend Analysis"
- "Channel Comparison Data"

### Takeaway Title (Good)
- "Email Marketing Delivers 9x More Conversions per Dollar Than Display Ads"
- "Shift Budget from Display to Email to Triple Conversion Efficiency"
- "Email's $60 Cost per Conversion Beats All Other Channels"
- "Display Ads Waste Budget: $556 per Conversion vs. Email's $60"

### Quick Test
Ask yourself: "If someone only read the title and nothing else, would they know:
1. What the key finding is?
2. What action to consider?

If yes to both → Insight-driven ✓
If no to either → Needs work

✅ "My data shows email has a $60 cost per conversion while display ads cost $556 per conversion"
```

### Ask for Multiple Options
```
❌ "Give me a title"
✅ "Give me 3 different title options with different angles"
```

### Request Explanation
```
❌ "Make it better"
✅ "Explain why this title is more effective than my original"
```

## Caution: AI Limitations

- AI may invent numbers - always verify against your actual data
- AI titles may be too long - aim for under 15 words
- AI may hedge ("may", "might", "could") - be confident if data supports it
- AI doesn't know your specific audience - adjust tone as needed

**Your judgment is the final filter. AI is a brainstorming partner, not a replacement for your critical thinking.**
