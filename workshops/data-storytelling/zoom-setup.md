## Breakout Room Rotation Strategy

### Group Exercise #1 (25 minutes)
Visit each room for ~4 minutes:

| Time | Room | Focus |
|------|------|-------|
| 0:15-0:19 | Room 1 | Observe initial approach |
| 0:19-0:23 | Room 2 | Note title strategies |
| 0:23-0:27 | Room 3 | Identify strong examples |
| 0:27-0:31 | Room 4 | Look for teaching moments |
| 0:31-0:35 | Room 5 | Find interesting angles |
| 0:35-0:40 | Room 6 | Final observations |

**What to observe (don't correct yet):**
- Are they focusing on insight or just data?
- What title styles emerge?
- Any creative visualization approaches?
- Note groups for later presentation selection

### Group Exercise #2 (20 minutes)
Shorter visits (~3 minutes each):

| Time | Room | Focus |
|------|------|-------|
| 1:10-1:13 | Room 1 | Coach on title refinement |
| 1:13-1:16 | Room 2 | Help with Knaflic principles |
| 1:16-1:19 | Room 3 | Guide AI prompt usage |
| 1:19-1:22 | Room 4 | Encourage iteration |

## Troubleshooting

### If a student can't hear/see
1. Ask them to leave and rejoin
2. Check their audio/video settings
3. Have them try a different browser or the Zoom app

### If breakout rooms won't open
1. Check that you're the host (not co-host)
2. Ensure breakout rooms are enabled in Zoom settings
3. Re-create rooms if needed

### If screen share freezes
1. Stop and restart share
2. Close unnecessary applications
3. Ask participants to turn off video temporarily

## Backup Plan

If Zoom has major issues:
1. Have Google Meet link ready as backup
2. Keep participant email list accessible
3. Have slides accessible via shared link (Google Drive)
