## Workshop Flow

---

## Block 1: Opening + Framework (0:00 - 0:15) — 15 min

**Objective**: Set context and introduce the DC ACT framework

**Show**: Title slide, then DC ACT Framework slide

### Script Outline

> "Welcome to our Data Storytelling Workshop. Today you'll learn the single most important skill for presenting analytics work: creating slides with Takeaway Titles that drive decisions.
>
> By the end of this session, you'll be able to take any data and create a slide that tells your audience exactly what they need to know and what to do about it. This is the skill that separates good analysts from great ones—and it's what hiring managers and capstone evaluators are looking for."

### Key Points to Cover

1. **Introduce yourself briefly** (30 seconds)

2. **Explain the workshop structure**:
   > "Here's how we'll spend our time: You'll try an exercise first, then I'll show you the gap between what most people do and what works. After that, you'll revise your work and some groups will present."

3. **Introduce DC ACT framework**:
   > "Everything we do in analytics follows this 5-step framework. Today we're focusing on step 4—Communicate."

   - **D**efine the business problem
   - **C**ollect and prepare the data
   - **A**nalyze the data and generate insights
   - **C**ommunicate the insights, recommendations, and predictions ← **Today's focus**
   - **A**ct and track the change

### Transition

> "Now let's see what step 4 looks like with a real scenario you might encounter at work."

---

## Block 2: Scenario Introduction (0:15 - 0:25) — 10 min

**Objective**: Present the Marketing Channel ROI scenario

**Show**: Scenario intro slide, then Dataset slide

### Script Outline

> "You're a marketing analyst at a startup. The CMO has asked you to present findings from last quarter's marketing spend. You have 5 minutes in the executive meeting to make your case.
>
> Here's the situation: The company spent $100,000 equally across four channels—$25,000 each on Paid Search, Social Media, Email Marketing, and Display Ads."

### Walk Through the Data

| Channel | Spend | Impressions | Clicks | Conversions | Conv. Rate | Cost/Conv. |
|---------|-------|-------------|--------|-------------|------------|------------|
| Paid Search | $25,000 | 500,000 | 15,000 | 350 | 2.3% | $71 |
| Social Media | $25,000 | 1,200,000 | 8,000 | 85 | 1.1% | $294 |
| Email Marketing | $25,000 | 150,000 | 12,000 | 420 | 3.5% | $60 |
| Display Ads | $25,000 | 2,000,000 | 4,000 | 45 | 1.1% | $556 |

### Key Points

- Walk through each column briefly
- **Do NOT reveal the insight yet**—let groups discover it
- Emphasize the task:
  > "Your job is to create ONE slide that tells the CMO what they need to know and what to do."

### Transition

> "Now you'll work in groups to create your slide. I'll assign you to breakout rooms."

---

## Block 3: Group Exercise #1 — First Attempt (0:25 - 0:50) — 25 min

**Objective**: Groups create their first slide (before instruction)

**Show**: Group Exercise 1 slide

### Instructions to Give

> "In your groups, create ONE Google Slide that:
> 1. Has a title
> 2. Has a visualization (chart, graph, or table)
> 3. Can be presented in under 2 minutes
>
> You'll present this to executives who need to make a budget decision. You have 25 minutes. I'll visit each room to check in."

### Breakout Room Assignment

Assign students to 6 rooms (~4 students each). Use Zoom's automatic assignment or pre-assign.

### Breakout Room Rotation Strategy

**Time per room**: ~3-4 minutes
**Total rotation**: Visit all 6 rooms

**In each room**:
1. Greet the group briefly
2. Ask: "How's it going? What are you thinking for your title?"
3. **Observe without correcting** (discovery learning!)
4. Note potential presentation candidates

### What to Watch For (Do NOT correct yet)

| Common Mistake | Example | Note for Later |
|---------------|---------|----------------|
| Descriptive title | "Marketing Channel Performance Q4" | Will address in gap reveal |
| Data dump | All numbers, no hierarchy | Will show visual focus |
| No clear message | Chart with no takeaway | Will teach Takeaway Titles |
| Missing recommendation | Analysis without action | Will emphasize "so what?" |

### Group Selection Mental Notes

While rotating, identify candidates for:

| Selection Type | What to Look For |
|---------------|------------------|
| **Strong example** | Clear insight, Takeaway Title |
| **Needs coaching** | Descriptive title, data dump—good teaching moment |
| **Interesting approach** | Creative or unexpected angle |

### Timing Calls

- **At 0:45** (20 min in): "5 minutes remaining"
- **At 0:48** (23 min in): "2 minutes remaining—finalize your slides"
- **At 0:50**: Bring everyone back to main room

### Transition

> "Great work everyone. Now let me show you something interesting about slide titles."

---

## Block 4: Gap Reveal + Knaflic Principles (0:50 - 1:05) — 15 min

**Objective**: Reveal the gap between descriptive and insight-driven slides

**Show**: Before/After slide, then Knaflic Principles slide

### THIS IS THE KEY TEACHING MOMENT

### Script Outline

> "Let me show you two versions of a slide from this data. Both use the same numbers. Watch the difference."

### Before/After Comparison

**BEFORE (Descriptive Title)**:
- Title: "Marketing Channel Performance Q4"
- Bar chart showing spend by channel
- No clear takeaway
- Viewer must interpret data themselves

**AFTER (Takeaway Title)**:
- Title: "Email Marketing Delivers 47% of Conversions on 25% of Budget—Reallocate Now"
- Same data, but chart highlights email's performance
- Title tells the viewer what to conclude
- Clear call to action

### Debrief Questions

Ask the room:
> "What's different about these two slides?"

Wait for responses. Then:
> "Which one would help the CMO make a decision faster?"

> "What did the second title tell you that the first one didn't?"

### Introduce Knaflic Principles

**Show**: Knaflic Principles slide

| Principle | Rule | Verification Question |
|-----------|------|----------------------|
| **Takeaway Titles** | Title states the insight, not the category | Does the title tell the viewer what to conclude? |
| **Sentence Case** | Capitalize first letter only | Does it read like a sentence, not a label? |
| **Single Line** | Title fits on one line | Is it concise? |
| **Visual Hierarchy** | Key data is visually emphasized | Can viewer find the key number in 3 seconds? |
| **Chart-Message Alignment** | Chart type supports the insight | Does the visualization make the insight obvious? |
| **Clutter Reduction** | Every element earns its place | Is anything unnecessary? |

### Key Teaching Points

> "The title is the most important element—it's what people read first and remember."

> "A Takeaway Title tells the viewer what to conclude: 'Email wins' not 'Here's the data.'"

> "Think: If someone only reads your title, do they know what to do?"

### Transition

> "Now you'll revise your slides using these principles. You can also use AI to help refine your titles."

---

## Block 5: Group Exercise #2 — Revision (1:05 - 1:25) — 20 min

**Objective**: Groups revise their slides using Knaflic principles + AI

**Show**: Group Exercise 2 slide

### Instructions to Give

> "Go back to your slides and revise them using what you just learned. Focus especially on your title.
>
> You can use AI to help. Try this prompt:
> 'I have a slide titled [your current title]. The key insight is [what you discovered]. Help me rewrite this as an insight-driven title.'
>
> You have 20 minutes. I'll come around to help."

### Breakout Room Rotation Strategy

**Now you CAN coach and give feedback**

**Guiding questions to ask**:
- "What's the one thing you want the CMO to remember?"
- "If they only read your title, would they know what to do?"
- "Which channel should they change their behavior on?"

**Help with AI prompts** if groups are struggling:
> "Try telling the AI what insight you found, then ask it to write a title that communicates that insight."

### Confirm Presentation Selections

During rotation, confirm your 3 groups:
1. Strong example (will present first)
2. Needs coaching (will present second)
3. Interesting approach (will present third)

Let selected groups know they'll be presenting.

### Timing Calls

- **At 1:20** (15 min in): "5 minutes remaining"
- **At 1:23** (18 min in): "2 minutes remaining—finalize your slides"
- **At 1:25**: Bring everyone back

### Transition

> "Let's see what you came up with. I've selected three groups to present."

---

## Block 6: Presentation Setup (1:25 - 1:30) — 5 min

**Objective**: Select and prepare presenting groups

**Show**: (No slide needed—verbal instructions)

### Script

> "I've selected three groups to present. Each group will have 3 minutes to present their slide, then we'll spend 4 minutes on feedback.
>
> [Name the three groups]
>
> When you present, walk us through:
> 1. What's the problem?
> 2. What data did you use?
> 3. What's the insight?
> 4. What's your recommendation?
>
> Everyone else: think about what's working well and what could be even stronger."

### Prepare Feedback Framework

You'll use these questions during feedback:
- What's the title telling us?
- Is the recommendation clear?
- Does the visual support the insight?

### Transition

> "Let's start with [Group 1 name]. Please share your screen."

---

## Block 7: Group Presentations (1:30 - 1:51) — 21 min

**Objective**: Groups present and receive feedback

**Format**: 7 minutes per group (3 present + 4 feedback)

### Presentation Order

1. **Strong Example** (1:30-1:37) — Model success, reinforce principles
2. **Needs Coaching** (1:37-1:44) — Show growth opportunity, coach live
3. **Interesting Approach** (1:44-1:51) — Highlight creativity, discuss trade-offs

---

### For Each Presentation

#### During Presentation (3 min)

- Let them present without interruption
- Note the title specifically
- Note if they follow: problem → data → insight → recommendation

#### During Feedback (4 min)

Start with:
> "Thank you. Let's discuss. [Audience], what did this title tell you?"

**Feedback Questions**:
- "What would you remember from this slide tomorrow?"
- "Is the call to action clear?"
- "What's one thing that could make this even stronger?"

---

### Coaching Points by Presentation Type

**For Strong Example**:
> "Notice how this title does the work for the viewer. They don't have to figure out what matters—the title tells them. That's what we're aiming for."

**For Needs Coaching**:
> "Good start. How could we make this title tell the viewer what to do?"
> "What if the title was: '[Suggested Takeaway Title]'?"

**For Interesting Approach**:
> "I like that you tried [creative element]. Let's discuss the trade-offs."
> "How does this approach serve someone making a quick decision?"

---

### Time Management

| Presentation | Start | Present | Feedback | End |
|-------------|-------|---------|----------|-----|
| Group 1 | 1:30 | 3 min | 4 min | 1:37 |
| Group 2 | 1:37 | 3 min | 4 min | 1:44 |
| Group 3 | 1:44 | 3 min | 4 min | 1:51 |

### Transition

> "Excellent work everyone. Let me summarize what we learned today and tell you about your take-home assignment."

---

## Block 8: Wrap-up + Assignment (1:51 - 2:00) — 9 min

**Objective**: Summarize key learnings and introduce take-home

**Show**: Take-Home Intro slide

### Summary Script (3 min)

> "Today you practiced the most important communication skill for analytics: creating insight-driven slides.
>
> Remember three things:
> 1. **Your title is your headline**—make it count
> 2. **Tell viewers what to conclude**—don't make them figure it out
> 3. **Connect your insight to a specific action**—the 'so what?'
>
> This is exactly what hiring managers look for in interviews and what will make your capstone presentations stand out."

### Introduce Take-Home Assignment (4 min)

> "For workshop credit, you'll complete an individual assignment.
>
> You'll receive a document with two 'bad' slides—each has a descriptive title and data.
>
> Your job: Pick ONE and transform it into an insight-driven slide with a proper title.
>
> You'll be evaluated on one thing: **Does your slide have an insight-driven title?**
>
> The two options are:
> - Option A: Website Traffic data
> - Option B: Employee Satisfaction data
>
> Choose whichever one interests you more. Both have hidden insights waiting to be discovered."

### Share Assignment

> "I'm sharing the take-home assignment document now. [Share link/file]"

### Final Questions (2 min)

> "Any questions about the assignment or today's workshop?"

Address questions. If no questions:

> "Remember: the key is your title. Make it a Takeaway Title, not descriptive."

### Closing

> "Thank you for your energy today. I saw real growth in those revisions. Now go make every slide count."
