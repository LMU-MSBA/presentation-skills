# PRD: Data Storytelling Workshop
## Transforming Analytics into Action Through Takeaway Titles

---

## Overview

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Duration** | 2 hours |
| **Format** | Live Zoom session |
| **Participants** | 23 analytics students |
| **Group Structure** | 6 groups (~4 students each) |
| **Foundation** | "Storytelling with Data" by Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic |

---

## Problem Statement

Analytics students can present data but create slides with descriptive titles that fail to tell a story or drive decisions. Titles like "Q3 Sales Data" don't communicate insights or instill confidence in recommendations.

**Current State**: Descriptive, passive titles → "Marketing Channel Performance"
**Desired State**: Insight-driven, actionable titles → "70% of Conversions Come from One Channel—Reallocate Budget"

---

## Learning Outcome

Participants will be able to **create a single slide containing an insight and supporting visualization** while articulating:

1. Here's the problem
2. Here's the data we used
3. Here's the insight
4. Here's my recommendation

### Connection to 5-Step Analytics Framework (DC ACT)

| Step | Framework Element | Workshop Focus |
|------|-------------------|----------------|
| 1 | **Define** the business problem | Given in scenario |
| 2 | **Collect** and prepare the data | Given in dataset |
| 3 | **Analyze** the data and generate insights | Group exercise |
| 4 | **Communicate** the insights, recommendations, and predictions | **Core skill taught** |
| 5 | **Act** and track the change | Implied in recommendation |

## Key Principles (Knaflic)

Based on [Transforming Slide Titles](https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/blog/2020/3/5/transforming-slide-titles):

| Principle | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Takeaway Titles** | Lead with the insight, not the category | "Customer Service: our weakest area" vs "Customer Sentiment" |
| **Sentence case** | Signals a complete thought, not a label | "Sales dropped 15% in Q3" vs "Q3 Sales Data" |
| **Single-line concision** | Reduces cognitive load | Keep titles to one line |
| **Punctuation shortcuts** | Colons/dashes for context → conclusion | "November: sales increased 10%" |
| **Highlight the "what"** | Use formatting to emphasize key data | Bold the critical number or finding |

## Workshop Structure

### Recommended Flow (2 hours)

| Time | Duration | Activity | Description |

| 0:15 | 10 min | **Scenario Introduction** | Present Marketing Channel ROI dataset and business problem |
| 0:25 | 25 min | **Group Exercise: First Attempt** | Groups create initial slide in breakout rooms; instructor rotates |
| 0:50 | 15 min | **Gap Reveal + Knaflic Principles** | Show common mistakes; teach Takeaway Title techniques |

| 1:51 | 9 min | **Wrap-up + Assignment** | Key takeaways; explain individual take-home assignment |

### Pedagogical Approach

**Discovery Learning**: Students attempt the exercise first (before instruction) to experience the gap in their skills. Feedback and teaching follow, making principles more memorable and relevant.

## Scenario: Marketing Channel ROI

### Business Context

A startup allocated its $100,000 quarterly marketing budget equally across four channels:
- Paid Search ($25,000)
- Social Media Ads ($25,000)
- Email Marketing ($25,000)
- Display Advertising ($25,000)

### Dataset Summary

| Channel | Spend | Impressions | Clicks | Conversions | Conv. Rate | Cost per Conv. |
|---------|-------|-------------|--------|-------------|------------|----------------|
| Paid Search | $25,000 | 500,000 | 15,000 | 350 | 2.3% | $71 |
| Social Media | $25,000 | 1,200,000 | 8,000 | 85 | 1.1% | $294 |
| Email Marketing | $25,000 | 150,000 | 12,000 | 420 | 3.5% | $60 |
| Display Ads | $25,000 | 2,000,000 | 4,000 | 45 | 1.1% | $556 |

**Total**: $100,000 spent → 900 conversions

### Key Insight

**Email Marketing delivers 47% of all conversions with only 25% of budget** (and lowest cost per conversion at $60).

Meanwhile, Display Advertising consumes 25% of budget but delivers only 5% of conversions at the highest cost ($556 per conversion).

### Expected Recommendation

Reallocate budget from underperforming channels (Display, Social) to Email Marketing. Proposed reallocation could increase conversions by 40-60% with the same total spend.

## Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Google Slides** | Slide creation and collaboration |
| **AI (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini)** | Refining slide titles from descriptive to Takeaway Titles |
| **Zoom Breakout Rooms** | Small group collaboration |

### AI Usage Guidelines

Students use AI to **refine their slide titles**, not generate the entire slide. Example prompt:

> "I have a slide titled 'Marketing Channel Performance.' The key insight is that email marketing delivers 47% of conversions with only 25% of the budget. Help me rewrite this as a Takeaway Title."

---

## Group Presentations

### Selection Criteria

Instructor selects **3 groups** while rotating through breakout rooms, choosing for diversity of teaching moments:

| Selection | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Strong example** | Model what success looks like |
| **Needs coaching** | Demonstrate common mistakes and live improvement |
| **Interesting approach** | Show creative or unexpected solutions |

### Presentation Format (7 min each)

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 3 min | Group presents slide and walks through problem → data → insight → recommendation |
| 4 min | Instructor feedback + group discussion |

---

## Individual Assessment

### Take-Home Assignment

Each student transforms **one of two provided "bad" slides** into a slide with a Takeaway Title.

**Submission Requirements**:
- Choose 1 of 2 bad slide options
- Create transformed version with Takeaway Title
- Submit for workshop credit

### Evaluation Criterion

**Primary**: Does the slide have a Takeaway Title (not descriptive)?

| Descriptive (Before) | Takeaway Title (After) |
|----------------------|------------------------|
| "Website Traffic Analysis" | "Organic Search Drives 60% of Traffic—Double Down on SEO" |
| "Customer Survey Results" | "Customer Service Scores Dropped 15 Points—Action Required" |

---

## Bad Slide Options for Take-Home

### Option A: Website Traffic Slide

**Original Title**: "Website Traffic by Source"

**Data Provided**:
| Source | Sessions | Bounce Rate | Avg. Duration | Conversions |
|--------|----------|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| Organic Search | 45,000 | 35% | 3:20 | 890 |
| Direct | 22,000 | 42% | 2:45 | 340 |
| Social | 18,000 | 65% | 1:15 | 95 |
| Referral | 8,000 | 38% | 3:05 | 180 |

**Hidden Insight**: Organic search delivers 59% of conversions; social media has highest bounce rate and lowest engagement despite significant traffic.

---

### Option B: Employee Satisfaction Slide

**Original Title**: "Q3 Employee Survey Data"

**Data Provided**:
| Department | Satisfaction Score | Response Rate | Turnover Rate |
|------------|-------------------|---------------|---------------|
| Engineering | 4.2/5.0 | 89% | 8% |
| Sales | 3.1/5.0 | 72% | 24% |
| Marketing | 4.0/5.0 | 85% | 10% |
| Operations | 3.4/5.0 | 68% | 18% |

**Hidden Insight**: Sales department has lowest satisfaction (3.1) and highest turnover (24%)—a costly retention problem requiring immediate attention.

---

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Participants can articulate problem → insight → recommendation | 100% |
| Group slides have Takeaway Titles (after revision) | 6/6 groups |
| Individual submissions demonstrate title transformation | 90%+ |
| Participant engagement in breakout rooms | Active participation |
