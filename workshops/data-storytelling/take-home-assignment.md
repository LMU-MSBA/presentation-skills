# Take-Home Assignment: Data Storytelling Workshop

## Instructions

You practiced transforming descriptive slides into slides with Takeaway Titles during the workshop. Now it's time to demonstrate this skill on your own.

### Your Task

1. **Choose ONE** of the two "bad" slides below (Option A or Option B)
2. **Analyze the data** to find the key insight
3. **Create a new slide** with:
   - An Takeaway Title (not descriptive)
   - A visualization that supports your insight
   - A clear recommendation

### What to Submit

- Your transformed slide (Google Slides, PowerPoint, or PDF)
- The slide must have an **Takeaway Title**

### Evaluation Criterion

You will be evaluated on **one thing only**:

> **Does your slide have an Takeaway Title?**

| Descriptive Title (FAIL) | Takeaway Title (PASS) |
|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| "Website Traffic by Source" | "Organic Search Drives 59% of Our Conversions" |
| "Q3 Employee Survey Data" | "Sales Department Has 3x Higher Turnover Than Engineering" |

**Remember**: An Takeaway Title tells the viewer what to conclude and what to do. A descriptive title just labels the data.

## How to submit

### Format
Submit as a **single-page PDF**. Here's how to export:

**Google Slides:**
1. File → Download → PDF Document (.pdf)

**PowerPoint:**
1. File → Export → Create PDF/XPS (Windows) or File → Save As → PDF (Mac)

**Keynote:**
1. File → Export To → PDF

### What we're looking for
- **Title**: Insight-driven, not descriptive
- **Visualization**: Supports the insight (not just displays all data)
- **Recommendation**: Clear "so what?" action

---

## Tips

1. **Start with the insight, not the chart.** What's the most important thing here? What should someone do about it?

2. **Write your title first.** If someone only reads your title, will they know what to do? Keep it to one line.

3. **Try AI for title ideas.** Prompt: "I have a slide about [topic]. The key insight is [your finding]. Help me write an Takeaway Title."

4. **Cut the clutter.** Only show data that supports your insight.

5. **Screenshot the data table as your visualization.** You don't need to create a fancy chart—a screenshot of the table works fine. Add callouts to highlight your key insight:
   - Circle or highlight the most important numbers
   - Add an arrow pointing to the key data point
   - Bold or color the critical row/column
   - Add a text box with a brief annotation (e.g., "3x higher!")
