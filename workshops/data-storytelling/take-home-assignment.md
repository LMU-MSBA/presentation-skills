# Take-Home Assignment: Data Storytelling Workshop

**Due: February 9 at 11:59 PM**

## Instructions

You practiced transforming descriptive slides into slides with Takeaway Titles during the workshop. Now it's time to demonstrate this skill on your own.

### Your Task

1. **Choose ONE** of the two "bad" slides below (Option A or Option B)
2. **Analyze the data** to find the key insight
3. **Create a new slide** with:
   - A Takeaway Title (not descriptive)
   - A visualization with a **callout** highlighting your key insight
   - No fancy charts required—screenshot the data table and add a callout

### What to Submit

- Your transformed slide (Google Slides, PowerPoint, or PDF)
- The slide must have an **Takeaway Title**

### Evaluation Criteria

You will be evaluated on **two things**:

> 1. **Does your slide have a Takeaway Title?**
> 2. **Does your slide have a callout highlighting the key insight?**

| Descriptive Title (FAIL) | Takeaway Title (PASS) |
|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| "Website Traffic by Source" | "Organic search drives 59% of our conversions" |
| "Q3 Employee Survey Data" | "Sales department has 3x higher turnover than engineering" |

**Remember**: A Takeaway Title tells the viewer what to conclude. A callout draws their eye to the evidence.

## Option B: Employee Satisfaction Slide

### Original Title (Bad)

### The Data

| Department | Satisfaction Score | Response Rate | Turnover Rate |
|------------|-------------------|---------------|---------------|
| Engineering | 4.2/5.0 | 89% | 8% |

## How to submit

### Format
Submit as a **single-page PDF**. Here's how to export:

**Google Slides:**
1. File → Download → PDF Document (.pdf)

**PowerPoint:**
1. File → Export → Create PDF/XPS (Windows) or File → Save As → PDF (Mac)

**Keynote:**
1. File → Export To → PDF

### What we're looking for
- **Title**: Takeaway Title, not descriptive
- **Callout**: Highlights the key data point (circle, arrow, color, or annotation)
- **Visualization**: Screenshot of the data table is fine—no chart required

---

## Tips

1. **Start with the insight, not the chart.** What's the most important thing here? What should someone do about it?

2. **Write your title first.** If someone only reads your title, will they know what to do? Keep it to one line.

3. **Try AI for title ideas.** Prompt: "I have a slide about [topic]. The key insight is [your finding]. Help me write an Takeaway Title."

4. **Cut the clutter.** Only show data that supports your insight.

5. **Screenshot the data table as your visualization.** You don't need to create a fancy chart—a screenshot of the table works fine. Add callouts to highlight your key insight:
   - Circle or highlight the most important numbers
   - Add an arrow pointing to the key data point
   - Bold or color the critical row/column
   - Add a text box with a brief annotation (e.g., "3x higher!")
